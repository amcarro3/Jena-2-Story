Schneewittchen was walking through the city and saw her favorite restaurant.
The airport had freshly grilled bratwurst and Rammstein music playing.
She had a flight to the Berlin Flughafen to visit her friends the 7 dwarfs.
Unfortunately, the 7 dwarfs didnâ€™t have Klimaanlage in their house and Schneewittchen began to sweat in her Dirndel.
Schneewittchen changed into her Lederhose - Then she and her 7 friends went to a nearby Biergarten
The eight companions pulled up in their stylish 7 series BMW that miraculously fit them all inside.
Feeling wettbewerbsfaehig, Schneewittchen had the Schnapsidee to argue that BMW used as much Gauss as Tesla.
